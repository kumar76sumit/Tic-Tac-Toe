# Tic-Tac-Toe
Hey everyone!
Hope you all are doing great, I am very excited to say that i have created a Project based on a game which everyone might have played, which is TicTacToe.
I have used technologies like Java FX for the UI Part and Java Language for the Backend Part.
A player wins the game if he ables to put all X/O in straight row or straight columns or any diagonal.
The score for each player will update in bottom of the Pane.
Hope you all will like it! :)
